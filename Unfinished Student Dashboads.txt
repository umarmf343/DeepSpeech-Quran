at student dashboar,  check the recitation panel and see if there are unfinished tasks are complete them all make sure it is fully ready and complete, production ready and fully functional.

fix them all, make sure they are tracked to the teacher adatabase, admin

if  there missing backend datasets (teacher database, student goals, activity feeds, leaderboards, etc.) 
and wide product/design decisions that are not present in the repository.
then create all the missing folders, files, snippets



Student Dashboard TODOs


Replace the hard-coded recentActivity array with data loaded from the student’s activity feed so the timeline reflects real progress.

Swap the static upcomingGoals list for real user goals pulled from storage to make the Current Goals sidebar accurate.

Enable inline editing or completion toggles for each goal entry so students can update progress directly from the dashboard.

Wire the “Set New Goal” button to a goal-creation flow instead of leaving it as an inert outline button.

Populate the Continue Your Journey card with the learner’s actual last-read surah/ayah rather than the fixed Surah Al-Baqarah example.

Hook the “View Habit” button to a real habit-detail route so it navigates somewhere meaningful instead of doing nothing.

Make the “Start New Surah” card clickable (e.g., wrap it in a <Link> or button) to open the surah selector instead of acting as a passive card.

Do the same for the “Audio Sessions” card so students can jump directly into audio-based practice from the dashboard.

Connect the Premium Gate CTA (“Start Premium Session”) to the actual premium upgrade or AI coach session start flow rather than leaving it as a dead button.

Feed dynamic data (e.g., personalized XP boost, session availability) into the premium promo block instead of the fixed “Earn +120 bonus XP” copy.

Swap the static achievements (“Week Warrior”, “Perfect Reciter”) for the student’s real badge history from their profile.

Convert the “View All Achievements” button into a link that routes to the /achievements page so users can browse their full badge collection.

Replace the sample leaderboard array with live rankings (class and global) fetched from the leaderboard API.

Add controls to toggle leaderboard scope (class/global) and time range (weekly/monthly) per the gamification requirements.

Move goal, activity, and leaderboard data sourcing into the useUser context so the dashboard stops defining placeholder arrays locally.

Provide loading and error states around dashboard metrics; the component currently assumes synchronous data from useUser and will flash incorrect UI if the context ever becomes async.

Replace the fixed LEVEL_TARGET = 500 constant with a value supplied by the user’s progression model so XP progress reflects reality.

Populate the “Daily Power-Up” value with the platform’s actual daily bonus instead of deriving it from the first habit entry.

Let students choose which habit appears as the featured quest in Continue Your Journey instead of always defaulting to habits[0].

Add empty-state messaging (and alternative actions) for scenarios where the user has no habits yet, avoiding the fallback to level 1 placeholders seen in the current markup.

Introduce a Teacher Feedback Center block that surfaces the latest annotated notes and audio feedback, which is called out in the specification but absent from the current dashboard layout.

Surface quick links to profile goals, badges, or journal entries to align the dashboard with the profile overview expectations in the spec.
